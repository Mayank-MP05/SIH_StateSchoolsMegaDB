# SIH_StateSchoolsMegaDB
Smart India Hackathon : Create Mega Database for all Schools and Students in Rulars of Sikkim so to help them with Data analysis and Modelling 

# Problem Statement
Schools in Sikkim are located in different terrain and during monsoon season itâ€™s very difficult to reach every school to get data. In govt sector sometimes we need data immediately in such scenario creating data is difficult We need a software or web portal which can store data of all students across the four districts .The data storage should be block level, district level and state level. As network is very challenging throughout the state of Sikkim. Software should be design such a way that data can be entry offline and later on put into the web when network is available. Design a desktop based application that records a variety of data like attendance or students as well as teachers, marks of students, and other statutory data as required by education department. Most important aspect of this application is sync only when network is available. It should additionally provide facility to upload file separately once in a month
